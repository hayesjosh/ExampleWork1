# **An Example of My Thought Process, Coding Ability, Machine Learning Expertise, and Communication Style**

## **Please view the Jupyter Notebook**


1. **Thought Process** I wanted to create an interactive web app that would incorporate user-input, large data, and machine learning. I love visaulizations and so I wanted to tackle a useful problem that could make fun visualizations as well. At the same time, a number of my friends were moving across the country after graduating, or looking for new areas to pursue a different career. Many of my friends were therefore reproducing the same work: trying to evaluate the competitiveness of different regions to determine where they might be able to live. For example, if you move to the Bay Area in California but you're unfamiliar with the region where should you start looking for housing? That many people were reproducing this fairly mundane work seemed like an opportunity to me. Let's automate that process!

2. **Coding Ability** I am responsible for nearly every line of the code related to this project. I downloaded data from multiple unique sources, requiring many manipulations and transformations in order to merge/join everything into a final dataset. I borrow a framework that maps county lines into Bokeh, but in doing so must contort my data into the appropriate format to flow through this framework. I am solely responsible for putting the resulting visualizations onto the web and creating the Flask app to respond to user input.

3. **Machine Learning Expertise** I did not want my app to just visualize past data. I wanted to predict future competitiveness across housing markets. This is a time-series problem and is trickier than it might seem at the outset. The majority of the notebook is dedicated to creating, evaluating, and iterating upon the machine learning models needed to create meaningful predictions.

4. **Communication Style** Data analysis is often about telling a story. Here you can see how I "think" with data, and how I respond to different challenges.

### Thank you for taking the time to review this work.
